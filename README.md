## Project

This project taught us how to take into account different aspects of Human-Computer interaction (HCI) when developing different types of software products. We learned a lot and from now on we first plan different user flows and interactions before touching a keyboard and developing applications

## About the field 

Have you ever wondered how we communicate with computers? It's not just about typing on a keyboard or clicking a mouse. There's a whole field of study called Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that dives deep into understanding this interaction. Let's break it down in simple terms!

1. What is HCI?
HCI is like the bridge between humans and computers. It's all about making technology easy and enjoyable for people to use. Think of it as designing user-friendly and intuitive interfaces, like the screens and buttons on your phone.

2. Why is HCI Important?
Imagine if every time you used a computer, it felt like trying to read a book written in a foreign language. That wouldn't be much fun, right? HCI aims to make sure using technology feels natural and effortless, making our lives easier and more enjoyable.

3. Who Works on HCI?
HCI experts come from various backgrounds. They can be computer scientists, psychologists, designers, and more. They work together to understand how people think and behave when using technology.

4. Designing with Users in Mind:
HCI experts conduct experiments and gather feedback to create designs that cater to users' needs. For example, they might ask people to try out a new app and see what they find easy or difficult.

5. Testing and Improving:
Remember how car companies crash-test their vehicles to make them safer? In HCI, researchers "test-drive" interfaces to find out what works and what doesn't. They then make improvements based on the feedback.

6. Future of HCI:
As technology keeps evolving, so does HCI. Experts are always coming up with new ways to make our interactions with computers even better. Think about voice assistants like Siri or Alexa - those are products of HCI!

Conclusion:
So, the next time you swipe on your phone, play a video game, or use any digital device, remember that there's a whole field of experts working behind the scenes to make that experience enjoyable and effortless for you. That's the magic of Human-Computer Interaction!
